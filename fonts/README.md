# Font Files

Place your Kippax Modern font files here:

## Required Font Files

For the Stadium Tours design, you need:

1. **Kippax Modern Condensed Extrabold** (for the "STADIUM TOURS" title)
   - File format: `.woff2`, `.woff`, `.ttf`, or `.otf`
   - Font weight: 800
   - Font style: Condensed/Extrabold

2. **Kippax Modern Regular** (for body text)
   - Font weight: 400

3. **Kippax Modern Medium** (for labels and UI)
   - Font weight: 500

4. **Kippax Modern Bold** (for buttons and emphasis)
   - Font weight: 700

## How to Add Fonts

1. **Drop the font files into this `/fonts/` folder**
   
2. **Name them clearly**, for example:
   - `KippaxModern-CondensedExtrabold.woff2`
   - `KippaxModern-Regular.woff2`
   - `KippaxModern-Medium.woff2`
   - `KippaxModern-Bold.woff2`

3. **Let me know the exact file names** and I'll update the CSS to use them

## Supported Font Formats

- `.woff2` (recommended - best compression)
- `.woff` (good browser support)
- `.ttf` or `.otf` (will work but larger file size)

## Where to Get Kippax Modern

If you have access to the font files from your Figma design or your organization's font library, place them here. The font is typically used by Manchester City FC and related projects.

## Next Steps

After you drop the font files here, tell me the file names and I'll update the HTML to use them!
